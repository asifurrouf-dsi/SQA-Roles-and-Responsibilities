### QA Engineering Roles: Skills, Tools, and Responsibilities in a Testing Team

The quality assurance engineer is vital to every tech product release.
Depending on team size and structure, QA is viewed and utilized differently, but tailored to specific organization needs.

Most often, software testing job titles are designated QA (Quality Assurance) or Tester. They may also include the following specifications:

#### technology: Selenium Tester

Other variations of QA-related job offerings are QA analyst, 
QA engineer, automation engineer, test automation developer, etc. 
However, this array of unique software testing roles ends up having similar responsibilities.
