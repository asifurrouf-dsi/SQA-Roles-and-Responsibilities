## QA Automation Engineer Duties and Responsibilities
Duties for QA automation engineers vary based on the type of web and mobile applications they work with and the size of the engineering team they are a part of. However, QA automation engineers perform several core duties, such as:

### Design and Execute Tests

QA automation engineers design automated tests to validate applications by creating scripts that run testing functions automatically. This includes determining priority for test scenarios and creating execution plans to implement these scenarios.

### Identify and Report Bugs

QA automation engineers analyze bug reports and highlight problems to help identify fixes for them. They deliver regular reports identifying these bugs to other members of the engineering team.

### Install Databases and Apps

QA automation engineers install and set up databases and backup applications to prevent errors and protect against data loss.

### Identify Quality Issues

QA automation engineers analyze systems to identify potential quality issues that could affect apps.

### Collaborate

QA automation engineers collaborate with other members of the engineering team to find the best methods for solving problems in apps and systems.

 

### QA Automation Engineer Skills and Qualifications
QA automation engineers are detail-oriented professionals with a high degree of programming skill and problem-solving abilities. Businesses look for QA automation engineers with the following talents:

### Programming
QA automation engineers use programming skills to write computer code and scripts in common computer languages, such as VBScript and Java
Analytical skills – QA automation engineers analytically examine bug reports, prioritize necessary tests, and streamline application functions through automated testing processes
Problem-solving skills – QA automation engineers use their problem-solving skills to find bugs and create fixes for them
Attention to detail – because QA automation engineers test web and mobile applications to find ways to improve them and isolate problems, these professionals are highly detail oriented
Communication skills – QA automation engineers need strong verbal communication skills to effectively collaborate with the engineering team and create written reports showing errors and testing plans
 

###  QA Automation Engineer Education and Training
QA automation engineers must have at least a bachelor’s degree in computer science, IT, software engineering, or a similar field. Many employers prefer QA automation engineers to have a master’s degree, though past work experience with manual and automated testing procedures can suffice for education.

QA automation engineers undergo a brief orientation period upon being hired, but training is not provided because these professionals already have the skills and education necessary to perform their job duties. The orientation period usually lasts no longer than two weeks.

 

###  QA Automation Engineer Salary and Outlook
Per job data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, computer systems analysts (including QA automation engineers) earn a median annual salary of $88,270. According to PayScale data, QA automation engineers earn a median salary of $76,760 annually. Jobs in this field are projected to rise 9 percent through 2026, which is as fast as the average national job growth rate.
Full benefits packages are offered to QA automation engineers. Most employers provide full-time QA automation engineers with health, dental, life, and vision insurance benefits, along with retirement options. After three or more months of employment, QA automation engineers also receive vacation and sick days. Some large companies offer extra perks to QA automation engineers, such as free meals and gym memberships.
